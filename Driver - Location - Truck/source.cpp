//REQUIREMENTS
//Imagine that we have three drivers who take turns in driving two trucks. If
//a driver wants to drive one of the trucks, the driver must use an access card.The
//card reader is attached to the truck door. Once the driver taps on the card reader
//a set of information about the driver and the truck will be sent in the form of a
//text file.The information that will be sent is :
//• Driver first name
//• Driver last name
//• Driver ID
//• Truck ID
//• Truck location(x, y).
//Once your program receives the information from the two trucks, it should
//calculate the distance between the two trucks. Moreover, it should calculate the
//distance between each truck and the origin (0, 0)
//• Use the sample data to test your code
//• The output of your code must be the three required distances as follows:
//The distance between the two trucks is : ?
//The distance between the truck(with ID = 178534) and the origin is : ?
//The distance between the truck(with ID = 245817) and the origin is : ?
